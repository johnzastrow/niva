# TODO

Parked work. See [`docs/planning/04-roadmap.md`](docs/planning/04-roadmap.md),
[`docs/planning/15-postgis-and-project-design.md`](docs/planning/15-postgis-and-project-design.md),
and [`docs/planning/16-anatomy-of-a-verb.md`](docs/planning/16-anatomy-of-a-verb.md) for context.

- [ ] **Real end-to-end run of the analyst plan (now including Task 5).** Run
  `examples/analyst_plan.niva` against the real data headless (the python3.14 + QGIS
  recipe), through the new Task 5 `project` lines, and confirm: outputs valid, `/tmp`
  flat (scratch fix holds), the repointed `.qgs` projects open and resolve to the clips.
  This is a verification/ops task, not a feature.

## Done
- [x] **Test-hardening pass** (v0.18.3) — live-QGIS + PostGIS tier now gates CI on the
  `qgis/qgis` image with a Postgres service; real-Postgres test tier; found & fixed the
  PostGIS-append PK bug.
- [x] **Raster-layer repointing in `project`** (v0.19.0) — `project … rasters=<dir>`.
- [x] **`style` verb** (v0.20.0) — `style apply|save <.qml|.qmd>`, persisting into a
  GeoPackage `layer_styles` table or a sidecar.

## Roadmap-noted follow-ups (not yet scoped)
- `project` / `style` `apply` to a **database-backed** layer (DB style table).
- `.qmd` metadata `apply` persistence into a container (currently sidecar only).
